# hack-team-separator
Generate PDF documents for judges containing which teams to judge, when, and where.

# Notes
Make majority of form submission fields required (to know for sure all submissions are real)

# TODO
Fix color-mismatch bug on generated PDF (Key color doesnt match with map color)
Fix bug when num teams equals num of judge pairs (edge case)
